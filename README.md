@author Celia Hough<br>
Track the availability of library books, keep files with book and student data, calculate late penalties. Original Java OOP made for a Computer Science class with the help of some classmates (authors noted in code). I was the leader of this project, helping my classmates by giving them diagrams and outlines and wrote the main code. Demonstrates object oriented programming, inheritance, implementation of interface, custom exceptions class.
